# Hospitality-Revenue-Analysis-Challenge-by-CodeBasics
I am thrilled to share that I have completed the #codebasicsresumeprojectchallange1, which is to "Provide Insights to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain." I worked on this project with the help of @dhaval patel sir and hemanad vadievel.

Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands is a chain of five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue.

I used Power BI for data cleaning , analyzing, and visualization.
